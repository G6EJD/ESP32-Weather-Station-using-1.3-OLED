# ESP32-Weather-Station-using-1.3-OLED

NOTE:
When Weather Underground was taken over by IBM, they effectively closed all Personal Weather Stations (PWS).
It is still possible to upload and download data, if when the take-over took place, you were maintaining a PWS.

For most now the service is closed, so I have added an OpenWeatherMap version, that will stilll work until June'24, after which there will be a minor change to the API call required, which I will undertake when needed.
You will need to obtain a new API key (probably) when the OWM service is revised.

So only use the ESP32_OWM_13OLED_Time_v01 version https://github.com/G6EJD/ESP32-Weather-Station-using-1.3-OLED/blob/master/ESP32_OWM_13OLED_Time_v01.ino
